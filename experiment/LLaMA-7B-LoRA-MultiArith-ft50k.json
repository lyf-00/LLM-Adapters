Since Nancy picked 38 carrots and her mother picked 47 carrots, the total number of carrots picked is:\n\n47 + 38 = 85\n\nNow, let's find the number of good carrots. Since only 71 of the carrots were good, the number of good carrots is:\n\n71 out of 85 = 71/85\n\nFinally, let's find the number of bad carrots. Since the total number of carrots picked is 85 and the number of good carrots is 71, the number of bad carrots is:\n\n85 - 71 = 14\n\nSo, there were 14 bad carrots in the garden.</s>",
